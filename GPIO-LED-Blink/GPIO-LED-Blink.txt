⭐ What this project does?
Makes an LED blink continuously using Python and GPIO pins.

🧰 Hardware Used

Raspberry Pi 4

1× LED

1× 220Ω resistor

Breadboard + Jumper Wires

🔌 Circuit Connection

GPIO17 (Pin 11) → LED Positive (long leg)

GND → LED Negative via 220Ω resistor

💻 Software & Tools

Thonny IDE / Raspberry Pi OS

📚 Python Libraries Required

RPi.GPIO, time

🧠 How it works?
Turns LED ON → waits 1s → OFF → waits 1s → repeats until CTRL + C.

🚀 How to Run

Paste code in Thonny → Run → LED blinks

Stop with CTRL + C

📝 Tips

Check GPIO pin numbers

Proper resistor connection prevents LED damage
