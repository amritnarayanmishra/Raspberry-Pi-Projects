⭐ What this project does?
Simulates a traffic light with 3 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green).

🧰 Hardware Used

Raspberry Pi 4

3× LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)

3× 220Ω resistors

🔌 Circuit Connection

GPIO17 → Red LED

GPIO27 → Yellow LED

GPIO22 → Green LED

GND → All LED negatives via resistors

💻 Software & Tools

Thonny IDE

📚 Python Libraries Required

RPi.GPIO, time

🧠 How it works?

Red ON → wait 3s

Green ON → wait 3s

Yellow ON → wait 1s → repeat
